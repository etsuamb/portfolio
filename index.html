        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I am Etsub Girma. I am currently a fourth-year Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa Science and Technology University. I am passionate about advancing my skills in Flutter development, driven by a strong interest in building innovative and functional applications.</p>

        <p>I have primarily focused on Flutter development and have gained hands-on experience in creating various app projects. In addition to mobile apps, I have contributed to web development projects, which has broadened my understanding of software development practices. My goal is to bring my ideas to life by creating useful, impactful applications, and I am also eager to expand my knowledge of related technologies, such as Python.</p>

        <p>This past summer, I completed an internship as a Mobile App Developer at Kefita Technologies PLC. In this role, I worked on developing applications for installable POS machines. This experience was both challenging and rewarding, providing me with practical exposure to the industry.</p>

</p>
        <p>In addition to coding, I love spending time with family, reading, and exploring new technologies. My goal is to continue growing my skills and contribute to impactful projects that enhance user experiences. </p>

    <section id="experience" class="experience-section">
        <h1>Experience</h1>
        <p>I am an ambitious person with the goal of mastering Flutter development, having already worked on developing several app projects as well as websites. Last year, I participated actively in the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC), wherein I engaged in several Flutter study sessions and gained experience in app development. I also took part in a hackathon and even in a capstone project which resulted in certificates awarded for my efforts and triumphs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I find myself at the moment enhancing my technical skills learning Python and improving my web development techniques on SheCodes, from which I have obtained a certificate as well.</p>

<p>This past summer, I completed an internship with Kefita Technologies PLC, where my focus was on the development of applications for Point of Sale (POS) systems. This experience greatly enhanced my technical abilities and provided me with practical industry knowledge, particularly in the development of POS apps.</p>
